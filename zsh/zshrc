# Discard duplicates from both $PATH and $path
typeset -U PATH path

# PATH configuration must be in .zshrc (not .zshenv) because macOS runs
# /usr/libexec/path_helper from /etc/zprofile, which reorders PATH based on
# /etc/paths and /etc/paths.d/*. Since .zshenv runs before /etc/zprofile,
# any PATH changes there get overridden. Setting PATH here ensures our
# custom order (with /opt/homebrew/bin first) is preserved.
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/.cargo/bin:$HOME/.config/emacs/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH
